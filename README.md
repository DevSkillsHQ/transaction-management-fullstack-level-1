# Interview Assignment: Account Management Backend - Level 1

üëã Hi there!

In this interview assignment, your task is to build a backend service that implements a predefined API spec.

The API defines a set of operations for creating and reading account transactions. 

See the [API spec](api-specification.yml) to get the idea of how the service should work. 

## What's included üóÇ
Apart from the API spec, we've also added an [API test suite](api-tests.json) that verifies the service functionality.

Run the tests with:

```shell script
npm install -g newman // Install the test runner
newman run api-tests.json // Run the tests
```

## What we're looking for ‚≠êÔ∏è

- **Use a SQL database as the service datastore.** We want to see how you design your database schema and SQL queries for working with the service data.
- **Create a backend service that implements the provided API.** Make sure all predefined API tests pass. It will involve the following:
  - Handling invalid HTTP requests;
  - Creating new transactions;
  - Retreiving the current account balance.
- **Optimize the GET endpoints for speed.** When designing your service, ensure that the GET endpoints remain fast with the database growing in size.
- **Organize your code as a set of low-coupled modules**. Avoid duplication and extract re-usable modules where it makes sense, but don't break things apart needlessly. We want to see that you can create a codebase that is easy to maintain.
- **Document your decisions.** Extend this README.md with info about how to run your application along with any hints that will help us review your submission and better understand the decisions you made.

## How to submit your solution üì¨

1. Commit your changes to a new branch called implementation.
2. Create a Pull Request from implementation.

## What to expect next üëÄ

1. An engineer will do a code review of your Pull Request. They might ask questions that you'll need to answer, so please watch for GitHub notifications in your mailbox.
2. In the end, the engineer who did the code review will merge your Pull Request. That's when your assignment is over.
