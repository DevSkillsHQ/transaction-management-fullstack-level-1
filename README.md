# Account Management Fullstack - Level 1

**Before you get started, please read [this guide](https://www.notion.so/Get-started-with-your-assignment-dade100d93054a6db1036ce294bdaeb6)** that walks you through how to submit your solution and get help.

### Time limit ‚è≥

Try not to spend more than **4 hours**.

### The challenge üéØ

Your task is to build a Fullstack app that integrates and implements this [API specification](api-specification.yml). The API defines a set of operations for creating and reading account transactions. You can use [editor.swagger.io](https://editor.swagger.io/) to visualize the spec.

#### Frontend mockup üß±

![Mockup](mockup.png)
 
#### Frontend specification üìò
* There's a form with two input fields: Account ID and Amount. Whenever the form is submitted, a new transaction with the collected data should be created on the backend, and the corresponding input fields are cleared. The HTML elements must have the following HTML attributes:
  * Account ID input field: `data-type="account-id"`
  * Amount input field: `data-type="amount"`
  * Form: `data-type="transaction-form"`
* There's a list of the previously submitted transactions. Every newly submitted transaction should appear at the top of the list. The HTML element that represents a transaction should include the following HTML attributes: `data-type=transaction`, `data-account-id={transaction-account-id}`, `data-amount={transaction-amount}`, and `data-balance={current-account-balance}`

### The focus areas üîç

#### Backend
- **Use a SQLite database as the service datastore.** We want to see how you design your database schema and SQL queries for working with the service data. We suggest using [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) as it doesn't require running a DB server, which simplifies running the tests in the pipeline.
- **Create a backend service that implements the provided API.** Make sure all predefined API tests pass. It will involve the following:
  - Handling invalid HTTP requests;
  - Creating new transactions;
  - Retreiving the current account balance.
- **Optimize the GET endpoints for speed.** When designing your service, ensure that the GET endpoints remain fast with the database growing in size.
- **Organize your code as a set of low-coupled modules**. Avoid duplication and extract re-usable modules where it makes sense, but don't break things apart needlessly. We want to see that you can create a codebase that is easy to maintain.

#### Frontend
- **Integrate with a REST API**. Using the provided API spec, figure out the right service endpoints to use.
- **Implement client-side form data validation**. The API has restrictions on the allowed data format. Make sure to do the required checks client-side before sending the data to the server.
- **Organize your code with components**. Extract components that help you avoid duplication, but don't break things apart needlessly. We want to see that you can implement the UI with sound HTML semantics.

#### General
- **Document your decisions**. Extend this README.md with info about how to run your application along with any hints that will help us review your submission and better understand the decisions you made.

### The provided boilerplate üóÇ
* The [service specification](api-specification.yml) in the Open API format.
* Automated tests to validate your solution. To run locally:
  * Install the required test dependencies with `yarn install` (please give it some time to download the necessary dependencies).
  * Update the `baseUrl` (where your Frontend will run) and the `apiUrl` (where your Backend will run) in [cypress.json](cypress.json).
  * Run your Fullstack app.
  * Run the tests with `yarn run test`. Alternatively, Backend tests only: `yarn run test:backend` or Frontend tests only: `yarn run test:frontend`.

### Before submitting your solution ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. Update the `baseUrl` (where your Frontend will run) and the `apiUrl` (where your Backend will run) in [cypress.json](cypress.json).
2. Update the [`build:fullstack`](package.json#L5) and [`start:fullstack`](package.json#L6) scripts in [package.json](package.json) that respectively build and run your application. **[See examples](https://www.notion.so/devskills/Fullstack-991deeab9622416389fd2fd9fb41da85)**.
